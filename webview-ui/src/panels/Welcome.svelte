            <h3>3.0.5 - 2024-10-29</h3>
            <h4>Fixed file locking issues</h4>
            <p>
                Fixed issues relating to file locking on certain platforms that prevented the
                extension from running.
            </p>
            <h4>Fixed the current file not refreshing when resetting an exercise</h4>
            <p>
                Previously, the contents of the current file would not refresh properly in the
                editor when resetting an exercise, showing the old state instead of the actual
                contents of the file on disk.
            </p>
            <h3>3.0.4 - 2024-08-29</h3>
            <h4>.csproj files are no longer included when submitting C# exercises</h4>
            <p>
                Previously, it was possible to modify and submit .csproj files which would cause
                errors during testing on the server.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the dependencies of the extension were updated, the minimum supported VSCode
                version was also updated to a more recent version. 1.86.0 was released in released
                in January 2024.
            </p>
            <h4>Fixed the TMC-langs CLI's permissions being set to 111</h4>
            <p>
                Previously, the CLI binary used by the extension had its permissions set to 111
                (-rw-rw-rw) when it was downloaded. From now, the permissions are set to 755.

            <h3>3.0.3 - 2024-02-26</h3>
            <h4>Fixed missing "Send solution to server" button when tests are ran successfully</h4>
            <p>This button existed in the old UI but was accidentally omitted from the new one.</p>
            <h4>Fixed running tests for exam exercises not working correctly</h4>
            <p>
                Previously, trying to run tests for an exam exercise would show an endless loading
                spinner.

            <p>
                The extension does not have trackers or telemetry. It’s open source, and anyone can
                verify what it does. See: <a href="https://github.com/rage/tmc-vscode"

                If you choose to submit your answer to a programming exercise to be graded to our
                server, the extension will send us the folder of that specific exercise. This folder
                contains only your solution to the exercise, and no other files are sent. This
                information will also include the language the server should use for error messages.
                The error message language is currently your computer’s locale. We may check the
                answers you submit for plagiarism, and we may use the IP address of the computer
                that submitted the exercise for blocking spam and preventing abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same applies if you choose to submit your answer to the TMC pastebin for sharing
                your solution to other students.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you interact with our server, e.g. log in, download, or submit exercises, we
                will send the version of this plugin in the requests. This is used for blocking
                outdated and potentially misbehaving plugin versions.
